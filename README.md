# The Colors of _Moby Dick_

Recently I came across the work of the artist [Peter Gorman](https://www.barelymaps.com/about). He's 
made a [cool poster](https://www.etsy.com/listing/791675598/every-color-in-moby-dick-poster)
that has every color in Moby Dick. Since we have easy access to this text 
via NLTK, I thought it'd be cool to recreate some of his work via Python. 

## Exercise Part 1

In Part 1 of this exercise, I'd like you to read in the file of colors I've created for you, 
stored in `colors.txt`. Use this to build a list of the colors in _Moby Dick_. In part 2, 
which will come in a few weeks, we'll build the list of colors ourselves. 

If you're curious, I grabbed all the colors from the [Wikipedia list of colors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_colors_(compact)).
